Any unsolicited PRs will be rejected without review.

If you want a new feature or a change to existing behavior, please make an issue first to discuss it, and it may or may not be implemented.  Reviewing, merging, and testing PRs for small changes usually takes more time than just implementing it myself, and in general, large changes to the plugin are unwanted (especially without significant discussion beforehand).
